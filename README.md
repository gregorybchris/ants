# Ants

Ant foraging simulation and visualization

## Next Steps

- [ ] Improve sector-based steering for foraging efficiency
- [ ] Use grid system to efficiently search pheromones and nutrients
- [ ] Scale initial strength of pheromones by time since leaving the nest/time since picking up a nutrient
